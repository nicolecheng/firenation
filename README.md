##Overview: 
In this Flask app, we will provide users with real-time MTA updates: where trains are, how far they are from the user’s location, and any major delays. This allows the grouchy New Yorker to be prepared for train troubles, should they occur. It will also provide an estimate of how much time one has to get to the station before the train arrives, aka whether or not one has enough time to make that much-needed stop at Starbucks.
