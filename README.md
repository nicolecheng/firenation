## Overview:
In this Flask app, we will provide users with real-time MTA updates: where trains are, how far they are from the userâ€™s location, and any major delays. This allows the grouchy New Yorker to be prepared for train troubles, should they occur. It will also provide an estimate of how much time one has to get to the station before the train arrives, aka whether or not one has enough time to make that much-needed stop at Starbucks.

## Installation:
### Using easy_install
easy_install --upgrade gtfs-realtime-bindings

### Using pip
pip install --upgrade gtfs-realtime-bindings

## How to Use:
- Click on which train you are interested in.
- Click on which station you are interested in.
- Look at the estimated arrival times and approximate distances.

Alternatively...
- Click on "Nearest Stations" to locate the closest station near you!
- Look at information regarding that particular station.
